# Automated-screenshot-generator

Your task for the case study is to create an automated tool for taking screenshots of homepages of five selected webpages. There is a tool https://www.screenshotmachine.com/, which automatically creates these screenshots and even has an API. Please get familiar with this tool and the API and create an application which with the API automatically saves these screenshots to Google Drive and then you share the Google Drive link with us. After you finish the case study upload your code to GitHub (or similar) and share it with us. Please ensure that the code is publicly accessible

Files Format:
Use screenshot width: 1920 pixels and height of 1080 pixels, Image format JPG. Use the following structure of creating the name of the screenshot file â€œID_name.jpg.
